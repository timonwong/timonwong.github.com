It's been a long time, [Octopress] is slow and painful to setup, after the death of
my silly hard drive, I'm too lazy so I give up setting a Octopress environment, even
writing new posts.

Eventually, I'm levaing, heading for [Hexo].

## Whatâ€™s Hexo?

Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. It parses your posts with [Markdown]
or other render engine and generates static files with the beautiful theme.
All of these just take seconds.
